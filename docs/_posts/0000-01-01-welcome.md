Note:
The Collections API in Java is made up of several core interfaces as per the diagram - note Maps are a bit different.

### Lists

You should already be familiar with using some implementations of the List interface.

---

### Exercise (30 mins)
Implement your own implementation of List 

Provide working implementations of the following methods:

```
boolean add(E e) 
boolean remove(Object o)
String toString()
``` 

Note:
Don't worry about writing robust code that checks for errors just the simplest working implementation, using an underlying array.
Allow 30 mins-ish to complete then discuss.

---

What did you notice about implementing a List using arrays?

Note:
Hopefully that some operations are hard, namely resizing and adding / removing depending upon element location.

---

There are other implementations of List that address some of these short-comings

The _right_ data-structure depends upon your requirements

Choosing an appropriate structure can make a **BIG** difference

---

Before we can talk about some of the other data structures we need to say something about equality

### Exercise (15 mins)
Write your own Advert class with a make, model, registration and price.

Implement the `hashcode` and `equals` methods for it
