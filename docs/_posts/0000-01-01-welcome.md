Note:
The Collections API in Java is made up of several core interfaces as per the diagram - note Maps are a bit different.

### Quiz

Note: Laptops closed

---

## Sets can contain primitives

1. true
2. false

<fragment/> Answer: 2. false

Note: Primitives are auto boxed

---

```java
Set<String> s = new HashSet<String>();
s.add("Mark");
s.add("Alec");
s.add("Sarah");
for (String n: s) System.out.print(n);
```

### What will be printed?

<fragment/> Answer: SarahAlecMark but it could just as well be MarkAlecSarah

---

```java
  public static void main(String[] args) {
      Set<String> s = new HashSet<String>();
      addFirstName("Pankhurst", "Emmeline", s);
      addFirstName("Wilding Davison", "Emily", s);
      addFirstName("Hay Abbott", "Wilhelmina", s);
      addFirstName("Pethick-Lawrence", "Emmeline", s);
      for (String n : s) System.out.print(n);
  }
  private static void addFirstName(String lastName, String firstName, Set<String> names) {
      names.add(firstName);
  }
```

### How many names will be printed?

<fragment/> Answer: three

Note: Why only one Emmeline?

---

### True or false… map values can be collections

1. true
2. false

<fragment/> Answer: 1. true

---

### True or false… keys in a map are iterated in the order they are added

1. true
2. false

<fragment/> Answer: 2. false

---

### True or false… lists can have empty slots

1. true
2. false

<fragment/> Answer: 2. false

---

### When you iterate a list…

1. the order is not defined  
2. the order is the order the items were added  

<fragment/> Answer: 2. the order is the order the items were added

---

### Which statement is true?

1. lists can not contain `null`  
2. lists can contain `null` once only  
3. lists can contain `null` multiple times  

<fragment/> Answer: 3. Lists can contain `null` multiple times

---

### If I add two items with the same key to a map

1. an exception is thrown  
2. two items are added  
3. one item is lost  

<fragment/> Answer: 3: one item is lost

---

### When adding things to maps, which statement is correct?

1. the key can be `null` but the value can not 
2. the key must not be `null` but the value can be
3. the key and the value can be `null`

<fragment/> Answer: c: the key and the value can be `null`

---

### True or false… you can put ‘null’ into a set

1. true
2. false

<fragment/> Answer: 1. true

---

### How did you do?

---

### The Set Interface

+ Contains no duplicate elements
  + Contain no pair of elements e1 and e2 such that e1.equals(e2)
+ May contain at most one `null` element
+ No way to access the elements in a guaranteed order

---

### Order depends on implementation

e.g. HashSet may appear consistent, but can change between versions.

---

### The List Interface

+ May contain duplicate elements
+ May contain any number of `null` elements
+ Elements are accessed in a defined order

---

### The Map Interface

+ Contains no duplicate keys
+ Keys and values can be `null`
  + Does not define how implementations will behave
+ Keys exposed as a Set
+ Values must be fetched by key
  + Entries exposed as a Set
+ Not actually a collection

### Lists

You should already be familiar with using some implementations of the List interface.

---

### Exercise (30 mins)

Implement your own implementation of List 

Provide working implementations of the following methods:

```
boolean add(E e) 
boolean remove(Object o)
String toString()
``` 

Note:
Don't worry about writing robust code that checks for errors just the simplest working implementation, using an underlying array.
Allow 30 mins-ish to complete then discuss.

---

What did you notice about implementing a List using arrays?

Note:
Hopefully that some operations are hard, namely resizing and adding / removing depending upon element location.

---

There are other implementations of List that address some of these short-comings

---

### Optional Exercise (30 mins)

Implement your own implementation of Set, based on your List (or an ArrayList if necessary) 

Provide working implementations of the following methods:

```
boolean add(E e) 
boolean remove(Object o)
String toString()
``` 

Note:
Don't worry about writing robust code that checks for errors just the simplest working implementation, using an underlying array.
Allow 30 mins-ish to complete then discuss.

---

What did you notice about implementing a Set using a list?

Note:
Hopefully that most of the hard work is done

---

The _right_ data-structure implementation depends upon your requirements

Choosing an appropriate structure can make a **BIG** difference

---

Before we can talk about some of the other data structures we need to say something about equality

---

### Exercise (15 mins)

Write your own Advert class with a make, model, registration and price.

Implement the `hashcode` and `equals` methods for it
